# **Financial Hub**

## A Brief Overview

The Financial Data Filtering App is a web application designed to streamline the process of analyzing and filtering financial data. Users can input various criteria‚Äîsuch as date ranges, revenue thresholds, and net income parameters‚Äîand quickly filter a dataset to identify relevant financial insights.

The app features a Flask API backend for managing and serving data and a dynamic frontend interface that enables users to interact with the data seamlessly. This tool is ideal for begineer investors who want to process and review financial data efficiently. The app has several pointers and useful information to help newcomers understand technical terms.

Users have access to a robust front end platform powered by React and Next.js.
All data is fetched from external API endpoints and all filtered/sorted data is processed server-side using Flask.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For building the front end and back end of the application.
- **Python**: Used for utility scripts and API handling.
- **Node.js**: Backend framework to handle server-side logic.
- **React**: For the interactive user interface.
- **Next.js**: Used for the front end of the platform.
- **Flask**: Handled data retrieval and served endpoints for robust backend support.
- **Railway**: Used to deploy and host Flask server externally.
- **Tailwind**: Used for dynamic styling in front end interface.
- **Shadcn/ui**: Provided UI components for user interaction.
- **Framer-Motion**: Used to create UI implementation.

### How to Retrieve Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API Key:

1. Go to ([https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com)).
2. Click on **Sign Up** to create an account or log in.
3. Once you log in, if not already redirected, select **Dashboard** on the top right.
4. You should see your API Key under **API Keys**, if not, select **API Details** with a Key Icon on the left.
5. Create your key and **copy** it.
6. Insert these values into your `.env.local` file:
```bash
nano .env.local
# Add the following:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
```

## Start the Flask Server:
```bash
python server.py
```
The server will run on ```http://localhost:5000```


## Update your .env.local File:
```bash
nano .env.local

#Add the following:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
If you are using another port make sure you specify that in the code.


## How to Run Server üöÄ
